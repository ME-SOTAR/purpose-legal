      <p>

      <h2>Data retention timeframe</h2>
      <p>
        Account data is deleted or anonymized within 30 days of a deletion request.

        security, billing reconciliation, or fraud-prevention obligations.

      <h2>What data is deleted</h2>
      <p>
        When your account is deleted, personal data such as your profile information,
        wellness logs, meal entries, uploaded images, and preferences are removed or
        anonymized. Data that cannot be linked back to you may be retained for analytics.

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are managed through the app store (Google Play or Apple App Store).
        Deleting your account does not automatically cancel an active subscription.
        You can manage or cancel subscriptions directly from your app store account.
